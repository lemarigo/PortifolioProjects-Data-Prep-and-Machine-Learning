## eBay - Shill Bidding Analysis  

Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Shill+Bidding+Dataset)  

About the project: Online retailer, eBay is providing an option of bidding to their customers globally. Bidding is employed to find the real price of items in the market based on the demand. The
price offered by anyone participating in this process is termed as a 'bid'. My goal is to use classification or clustering algorithms to predict the bids in the future.
